# Blet_bot
Telegram bot that helps users prepare for ticket-based exams.
You can see how it works on https://telegra.ph/Kak-blet-05-07. And u can try using it in telegram https://t.me/blet_bilet_bot, but time is limited because the server is paid up to 27.06.2023.
<br><br>

Now the project is closed because the development didn't become popular among users. And it may never be finalized.
